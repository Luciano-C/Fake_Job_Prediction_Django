## <ins>About this project</ins>
This project aims to practice some of the things I have been learning lately about Machine Learning, specifically about Logistic Regression and TfidfVectorizer from Scikit-Learn and being able to integrate those into a Django app.  
Please note that because the main focus of this project was the integration, both the model and the app are relatively simple.

**Note that if you installed the requirements to run the Django project, you don't need to install them again for the Jupyter Notebook and vice versa.**
