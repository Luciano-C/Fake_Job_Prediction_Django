## <ins>About this project</ins>
This project aims to practice some of the things I have been learning lately about Machine Learning, specifically about Logistic Regression and TfidfVectorizer from Scikit-Learn and being able to integrate those into a Django app.  
The model evaluation in this case was purely based on accuracy score so there may be some options to optimize the model.

**Note that if you installed the requirements to run the Django project, you don't need to install them again for the Jupyter Notebook and vice versa.**
